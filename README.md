# QMK Keymap

This repository contains my personal keymap that I designed for the [ErgoDash keyboard](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash). I created this repo because the qmk_firmware repository was too big, and I wanted to share my keymap with others.

To use my keymap, you need to first download the entire [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) repository. After that, navigate to the following directory: `./qmk_firmware/keyboards/omkbd/ergodash/rev1/keymaps` and copy the folder named ./keymap/azalurg there.

Once you have added my keymap, you can flash the firmware by using the command:

```bash
qmk flash -kb omkbd/ergodash/rev1 -km azalurg. 
```

This will allow you to use my personalized keymap on your keyboard. I hope that you find my keymap useful and that it enhances your overall typing experience.
